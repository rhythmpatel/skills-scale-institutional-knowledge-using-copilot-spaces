# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — Overview & Index

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documentation. Use this README as the entry point for project-level processes, roles, and key artifacts.

Purpose
- Provide a centralized entry point for project management practices at OctoAcme.
- Summarize core processes and lifecycle stages for rapid orientation.
- Link directly to detailed documentation for each workflow, guide, and role.

Project Management Principles
- Customer-first: deliver value iteratively with clear ownership and measurable outcomes.
- Iterative delivery: ship small, testable increments and validate outcomes.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Lightweight, actionable documentation: keep guidance concise and practical.
- Visible decision-making and risk tracking: record trade-offs and escalation paths.

Lifecycle at a glance
1. Initiation — Define the problem, stakeholders, and success metrics (Project One‑pager).
2. Planning — Build backlog, estimate, identify dependencies and risks, and create a release plan.
3. Execution — Deliver in increments, track progress, enforce quality gates, and test.
4. Release — Deploy using standardized checks, run smoke tests, and communicate the rollout.
5. Retrospective — Capture learnings, track action items, and iterate the process.
